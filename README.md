### Sandbox to house my adventures in machine learning

* [Random fun with Pytorch style transfer](https://github.com/abelpd/Data_Science_Learning/blob/master/py_torch_style_transfer/Random%20fun%20with%20style%20transfer.pdf) - prebuild model by Alexis Jacq https://alexis-jacq.github.io

* [Stress testing a driver model for a delivery startup](https://github.com/abelpd/Data_Science_Learning/blob/master/driver_model_stress_test/driver_model_final.ipynb) - Sampled fake deliveries from a beta distrubution to estimate number of drivers required to maintain 60 minute SLAs for an on demand delivery.
